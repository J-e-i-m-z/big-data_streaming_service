### Big Data Streaming Set-up
## Overview

- This project is a comprehensive research endeavor focused on establishing a big data streaming service utilizing popular tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache NiFi, and Apache Airflow. 
- While the implementation is still in progress, this document outlines my extensive research and the proposed architecture to create and manage data pipelines efficiently.
- The goal of this project is to demonstrate a deep understanding of how to architect a solution capable of processing and analyzing data from both transactional databases (SQL-based) and analytical databases (NoSQL). The insights gathered here reflect my commitment to mastering the intricacies of data pipelines in a big data context.

## Introduction
- Data engineering is a crucial phase of the modern data ecosystem that enables companies to store, process, and make sense of large amounts of data. Creating robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant data pipelines is a complex task that requires multiple tools and techniques
-Big data streaming services enable real-time data processing and analytics, allowing organizations to make informed decisions based on current data.
- This project aims to integrate various components into an efficient data pipeline capable of handling high volumes of streaming data.

## Architecture
1. **Ingestion**: Raw data is ingested into the system using Kafka. The data can come from various sources like sensors etc.
2. **Processing**: Airflow schedules Spark jobs to process the raw data. The processing that we perform on our data should follow the business objectives.
3. **Storage**: Processed information is kept in Cassandra for NoSQL tasks or in PostgreSQL for structured data retention.
4. **Orchestration**: Each architectural piece is contained within Docker, guaranteeing isolation and straightforward setup.

## Tools and Technologies
1. **Apache Kafka**: A distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day, ideal for building real-time data pipelines.
2. **Apache Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, offering high-level APIs for data manipulation.
3. **Apache NiFi**: A data integration tool that automates the flow of data between systems, enabling data ingestion and transformation.
4. **Apache Airflow**: A platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows, perfect for orchestrating complex data pipelines.
5. **SQL Databases**: Transactional databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
6. **NoSQL Databases**: Analytical databases like MongoDB or Cassandra for unstructured or semi-structured data storage.

## Data Pipeline Design

1. **Data Ingestion**: Using Apache NiFi
   - Apache NiFi is used for automating and managing the flow of data from multiple sources into the Kafka ecosystem. It allows for easy integration with different databases, ensuring that the pipeline remains flexible and adaptable to various input formats.

   #### Design Steps:
   - **Install Apache NiFi**: Set up NiFi on a dedicated server or container, ensuring it has sufficient resources for high-throughput operations.
   - **Configure Data Sources**: Connect NiFi to both SQL-based transactional databases (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra). Use NiFi processors like `QueryDatabaseTable` for SQL sources and `GetMongo` for MongoDB to extract and fetch data.
   - **Data Transformation**: Use NiFi processors like `ConvertRecord` or `UpdateAttribute` to convert data formats (e.g., from JSON to Avro or CSV) and enrich data streams with necessary metadata. Implement routing logic using `RouteOnAttribute` or `RouteOnContent` to direct different types of data to appropriate Kafka topics.
   - **Data Publishing to Kafka**: Use `PublishKafkaRecord_2_6` processors to publish the transformed data into specific Kafka topics. Set up retries and error handling mechanisms to ensure data is not lost during ingestion.

2. **Data Streaming**: Apache Kafka
   - Kafka serves as the backbone for transporting and streaming data across the pipeline, providing a reliable, distributed messaging system that scales easily.

   #### Design Steps:
   - **Kafka Cluster Setup**: Deploy a Kafka cluster with multiple brokers to ensure fault tolerance and high availability. Configure ZooKeeper (if using older versions of Kafka) for managing the Kafka cluster or use KRaft mode (Kafka’s built-in quorum controller) for a more streamlined setup.
   - **Topic Configuration**: Create topics for different types of data streams, such as `transactions`, `user_activity`, or `system_logs`. Configure topic partitions to ensure scalability and balanced load distribution among consumers. Enable replication for each topic to ensure data durability in case of node failures.
   - **Data Producers and Consumers**:
     - NiFi acts as the producer, publishing data to the designated Kafka topics.
     - Ensure consumers (e.g., Spark Streaming jobs) are configured to read from these topics efficiently.

3. **Data Processing**: Apache Spark
   - **Purpose**: Apache Spark is used to process the streaming data in real-time, performing transformations, aggregations, and analytics that provide valuable insights.

   #### Design Steps:
   - **Spark Cluster Setup**:
     - Deploy a Spark cluster configured to run in **cluster mode** with multiple worker nodes for distributed processing and high fault tolerance.
     - Integrate the Spark cluster with **YARN** or **Kubernetes** for resource management.
   - **Configure Spark Streaming**:
     - Set up Spark Streaming to read data from Kafka topics using the **Structured Streaming API** or **DStream API**.
     - Write transformations (e.g., filtering, mapping) and aggregations (e.g., `groupBy`, `count`) using Spark’s built-in functions.
     - Perform **windowed operations** on the streaming data to analyze data over time periods (e.g., per minute/hour).
   - **Error Handling and Checkpointing**:
     - Implement **checkpointing** in Spark to handle failures and resume processing from the last successful state.
     - Include error handling logic in transformations to manage faulty records gracefully (e.g., sending them to a dead-letter topic in Kafka).

4. **Workflow Management**: Apache Airflow
   - **Purpose**: Apache Airflow is employed to orchestrate the entire pipeline, automating the execution and monitoring of various tasks in the data flow process.

   #### Design Steps:
   - **Install Apache Airflow**:
     - Set up Airflow on a dedicated server or containerized environment and configure the **Scheduler**, **Web Server**, and **Workers**.
   - **Define Data Pipeline DAGs**:
     - Create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that define the workflow sequence for the pipeline, such as:
       - **Data Ingestion DAG**: Automates NiFi processor configuration and Kafka topic creation.
       - **Data Processing DAG**: Manages the execution of Spark jobs, including task dependencies and error handling.
       - **Data Archival and Storage DAG**: Automates data export and storage processes to analytical databases like Cassandra or cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
   - **Task Monitoring and Alerts**:
     - Set up SLAs and monitoring rules to track the execution of tasks and workflows.
     - Configure alert mechanisms (e.g., email or Slack notifications) for any task failures or delays, ensuring timely response and mitigation.

5. **Data Storage and Archival**:
   - **Transactional Data Storage**:
     - Data from SQL sources can be stored in real-time SQL databases (e.g., MySQL) for immediate analysis and operational reporting.
   - **Analytical Data Storage**:
     - Transformed and aggregated data can be pushed to NoSQL databases like Cassandra or MongoDB for long-term storage and advanced analytics.

6. **Data Validation and Quality Assurance**:
   - **Schema Registry**:
     - Use **Confluent Schema Registry** to manage data schemas for Kafka topics, ensuring consistency and compatibility between producers and consumers.
   - **Data Quality Checks**:
     - Implement data quality checks using NiFi and Spark (e.g., verifying required fields, checking for null values, and enforcing schema conformity) before further processing.
   - **Auditing and Logging**:
     - Integrate Apache Airflow’s logging capabilities and Kafka monitoring tools (e.g., **Kafka Manager**) to maintain a comprehensive log of all events, transformations, and processing activities.
